            <h2>Website Recommendation & Brand Vision</h2>
            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
            <p>Thank you for reviewing the two design proposals. To begin, I recommend a clean and functional website that highlights your contact information, showcases your pizza menu, and includes clear links for customers to easily get in touch. It's a simple yet powerful way to support your presence at the farmer's market and start building your online identity.</p>
            <p>I'd be delighted to help you bring this website to life. The only ongoing cost to keep in mind is the domain name, which renews annually and typically costs around $15 USD. In the meantime, it's worth thinking about a name for your website, something that reflects your style and is easy for customers to remember.</p>
            <p>As you shape your business, here are a few questions that might help you envision its future:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Would you be open to making pizzas for weddings, private gatherings, or special events?</li>
                <li>Do you see yourself offering custom orders or delivery services down the line?</li>
                <li>What kind of customers do you hope to attract and serve?</li>
            </ul>   
            <p>Reflecting on these ideas can help clarify your brand's direction and how your website can support it. I'm here to guide you through each step of the process and make it as smooth and inspiring as possible.</p>
            <p>Warmly,<br>Analina Nielsen</p>
